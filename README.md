##TODO
* Fix playing on mobile devices (Try to play, if state is not playing, stop)
* M-Key for mute/unmute.
* Support for very small devices (320px) because of volume slider.
* Better README.md
* Settings (Maybe for notifications and thumbnails...)
* List of keyboard shortcuts -> in same Screen as settings?
